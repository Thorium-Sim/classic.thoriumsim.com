          <h1>Support Service Request</h1>
          <p>
            Thorium offers support service to help you make sure Thorium is
            working smoothly and correctly. Have a feature you want added in a
            hurry? How about a bug that needs to be fixed quickly? Need someone
            to come on site to help you get everything working right? Then fill
            out this form, and we'll make it happen!
          </p>
          <Form />
          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <h4>What is this?</h4>
          <p>
            Filling out this form allows you to request a Thorium expert to
            either work on bugs or features for Thorium or provide an on-site
            visit. They can help you with anything you need to get Thorium
            working for your space center.
          </p>
          <h4>Is this a service contract?</h4>
          <p>
            No, there is no contract being signed through this form. This form
            is just a notification system. Filling it out informs the support
            team of your need. They'll get in contact to give you expectations
            of when and how to expect your service.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Filling out this form is not a guarantee of service. We reserve
              the right to refuse service for any reason.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <h4>What if I don't want to pay for my feature or bug?</h4>
          <p>
            As always, you can submit an issue through{" "}
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues/new"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener"
            >
              Github's issue tracker
            </a>{" "}
            or Thorium's built-in issue tracker. Those issues are handled based
            on the project's roadmap and developer availability. There is no
            guarantee that features and bug reports submitted through the issue
            tracker will be completed.
          </p>
          <h4>Who is the service provider?</h4>
          <p>
            Currently, the only service provider is Alex Anderson. Eventually
            other talented Thorium developers and users could provide service to
            you as well.
          </p>
          <h4>
            What if I request high priority service and the service is late?
          </h4>
          <p>
            You will be billed for the service level that you recieve. If you
            request a high-priority on-site visit within 2 hours and it takes 4
            hours for someone to arrive, you will be billed at the lower medium
            priority level.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if you request a low priority visit and someone arrives
            within 2 days, you will still be billed at the low priority visit.
            No surprises.
          </p>
          <h4>How will payment be handled?</h4>
          <p>
            Within a month of any service being provided, you will be sent an
            invoice with the service charges. You will be expected to provide
            payment within one month from the invoice. Failure to do so will
            result in refusal of all future service requests until the invoice
            is paid.
          </p>
          <h4>Will you visit my space center without a service request?</h4>
          <p>
            Doing on-site visits is incredibly valuable for Thorium's
            development. It helps us understand customer need, discover hidden
            bugs and issues, and hopefully builds trust between the developers
            and the space centers. However, it is also very time consuming and
            expensive. The time it takes to travel, discover and resolve the
            issues, can be taxing on those of us with families, jobs, and school
            work.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we do reserve the right to do service calls pro-bono, we
            encourage space centers to help support Thorium and the developers
            by paying for the service that was requested.{" "}
