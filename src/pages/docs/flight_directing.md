The Flight Director is probably the most important person in a Thorium mission.
Without the Flight Director, nothing would happen. A Flight Director could be compared to the 'Game Master' or 'Dungeon Master' in other types of role playing games. It is the Flight Director's job to monitor the crew, update the simulation based on their actions, and drive the story line. The Flight Director is a professional storyteller.

The Flight Director will guide the mission through the following steps:

1. [Mission briefing](/docs/fd_briefing.html)
2. [Station Training](/docs/fd_training.html)
3. [Acting](/docs/fd_acting.html)
4. [Starting the Mission](/docs/fd_starting_mission.html)
5. [Executing the Mission](/docs/fd_mission.html)
6. [Battles](/docs/fd_battles.html)
7. [Death Time](/docs/fd_death.html)
8. [Away Missions](/docs/fd_away_missions.html)
9. [Mission Completion](/docs/fd_mission_complete.html)
