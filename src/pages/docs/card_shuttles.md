The shuttle card is used to deploy shuttles. Shuttles can be used for a variaty of mission operations. Once a shuttle prepares for departure, the user can unattach the clamps, compress the airlock, and open the doors allowing the shuttle to depart. Multiple shuttles can be configured to show on this screen.

Once the shuttle has been prepped for departure, the FD must send off the shuttle by unchecking the "Pr" checkbox in the shuttles core. When the crew recalls the shuttle, the FD can assign the shuttle as "Arriving" which will then prompt the crew to begin arrival procedures to receive the shuttle. Shuttlebays must also have their doors closed and compression happen to be considered secure once a shuttle has left.
