Transporters are used to transport objects from one place to another (very similar to Star Trek when they energize people or cargo.) The user first scans for an item and where they'd like to send it, the FD will punch in how many items are available to transport. Then a screen will show up for the user to select an object and charge up the connection the the object, at which point the object will be transported.
