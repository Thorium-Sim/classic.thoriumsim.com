Mission writing is a critical piece of Thorium. Since Thorium must be supplimented with a storytelling aspect, it's important that the FD has a good story to tell. Stories should be told through a mission, a timeline of events and objectives to be coompleted. Missions can be configured on the mission config screen which allows for some automation as the timeline continues. Additionally, the FD (or assistant, AKA "second chair"), should help tell that story through characters onboard their ship, enemies they may communciate with, an onboard computer, etc. The only limit here is ones imagination.
