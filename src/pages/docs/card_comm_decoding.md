This is where incoming long range messages are decoded. Unless specified on the
Core, every message sent will have to be decoded.

On the right side of the screen is a list of message that have arrived,
including a (faux) stardate and the name of the message sender. Clicking on the
message will make the encoded message appear in the box at the bottom, along
with activating the decoding matrix.

To decode the message, the frequency and amplitude bars must be lined up with
the incoming signal wave. Clicking the 'Decode' button will decode the message
based on the signal waves. If they match, the message is decoded.

The decoding core is simple. A gray box lets you type in the message you want to
send. The top yellow box is the message sender. The yellow box can be filled in
automatically by typing a line with '**Ship Name** out'. **Ship Name** will be
put into the yellow box.

You send the message with the 'Send' button. 'Clear' empties the box. Checking
the 'Decoded' box makes it so the message doesn't show up encoded and can be
read immediately.
