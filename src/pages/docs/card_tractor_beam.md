The tractor beam can be used to pull in items from space. The stress level on the tractor beam can be set by the FD, the strength of the beam can then be adjusted by the user to match or beat that stress. Once the item has been pulled in, the FD can turn off the tractor beam and turn off the target in the Tractor Beam Core.
