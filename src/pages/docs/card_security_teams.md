Security Teams are crafted from members of the crew. If you find your ship has a disturbance or traitor onboard, you can send a security team to go take care of the situation. Teams can be named, given orders, sent to a specific room on a specific deck, and assigned a priority. Security teams can even be messaged to see what their status is. (The FD would then respond on their behalf.)
