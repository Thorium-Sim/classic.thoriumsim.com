Damage teams are teams created from members of the crew (typically, other crew members that are not actual users) that have specific roles. Damage reports may require a damage team of technicians and engineers to go fix a system. The user with this card can create a team from the available configured crew and send them to go fix a system. The FD can then acknowledge when they've repaired something. Messages can even be sent to the damage team to ask how the repair is going to which the FD can respond with their progress.
