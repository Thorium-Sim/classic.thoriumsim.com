Thorium support configuring MIDI boards to perform actions in the controls. These MIDI boards could have sliders, rotors, and buttons, all of which can affect things in the simulator.

Two models of MIDI board are supported:

* X-Touch MINI
* Behringer BCF 2000

More models could be added in the future. If you are interested, get in touch with Alex or file an issue.

MIDI Boards are configured from the sidebar of Thorium. Multiple MIDI configurations can be assigned to a simulator at once, and they can be changed mid-flight.

When configuring a MIDI set, you must first choose the MIDI board which you want to use. A diagram of the MIDI board shows which controls can be configured. Clicking on the control selects it, allowing you to add actions to the control. You can also select controls by manipulating a MIDI device plugged into the computer.
