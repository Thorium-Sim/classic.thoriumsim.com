There are times when the crew will fail. This is a good time as a Flight Director to pause the mission (blacking out all stations) and discuss the successes and failures of their team. 

It has also been known that during this "death time" music was played as punishment. The crew must listen to the music, either in silence or while discussing new plans (Flight Director's choice), before the mission can be retried. Again, it is the Flight Director's choice where they resume. Do they start from the beginning or a few timeline steps back?
