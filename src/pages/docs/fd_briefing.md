Before a mission can begin, the crew has to know what their mission is in the
first place! At very least, they should be given an explanation of what they are
going to be doing. Explaining what capabilities their ship has, which country
the crew represents, basic stellar geography (other alien races they might
encounter, where their ship is currently located, etc.). The crew should at
least have context for what is happening when their mission begins.

Except in very rare circumstances, every mission has a briefing associated with
it. The briefing should be included in the mission in some way. The best Flight
Directors deliver the briefing without notes, but slides or tactical screens can
be used to illustrate. If slides or tactical screens are not available, the
flight director should illustrate the points of the mission using a whiteboard
or by drawing on paper. Every effort should be made to help the crew understand
what they are doing.

If possible, the mission briefing should very clearly outline the mission
objectives. These are the key, critical points of the mission which must be
accomplished for the crew to complete the mission successfully. By outlining the
points of the mission one by one, the crew is much more likely to remember what
they are supposed to do during their mission.

This time should also be devoted to assigning the crew their positions. The
Flight Director should be well aware of what station set the simulator is
configured to use before the briefing begins so the crew can be given the
appropriate positions. If available, uniforms should be distributed. If the crew
isn't already on the simulator, they should be escorted to the simulator.
