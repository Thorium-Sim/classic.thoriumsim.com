The Jump Drive is supplemental to the engines allowing your ship to travel faster than the speed of light by creating an envelope of spacetime. The Jump Drive does not provide propulsion to your ship on its own. On this screen you can activate the Jump Drive, select the size of the envelope around your ship (larger envelopes allow for more ships to follow in your envelope) the power on all four sides of the envelope, and the stress of the envelope. The bigger the stress on the envelope, the greater likelyhood of damage to your ship and crew.
