The computer core card allows the user to see system users, files, terminals, and allows the user to scan for viruses. To keep the computer core of the ship running smoothly, users will need to restore corrupted files, remove hacker profiles, remove viruses, and restart malfunctioning terminals.

Pictured here is the FD core which allows the FD to add in a virus and hacker. They can also see what files and users are on what access level. When a virus and/or hacker is added, a history of events will show at the top. The virus/hacker will corrupt files and systems at random until the user removes the virus/hacker.
