Exocomps are little robots on your ship that allow you to send on repair missions. These can be integrated with tasks or damage reports as steps to repair a system on the ship. Parts can be attached to the exocomp, they will take those parts to the system they are going to repair. Exocomps will take time to travel to the system, repair the system, and come back. If the system does not need repairs, they will let you know.
