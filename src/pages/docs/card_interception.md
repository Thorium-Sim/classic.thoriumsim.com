The Interception card takes a bit of back and forth from the FD. The FD can check the "incterception" checkbox on the InterceptionCore which will allow the comm's officer to select a button to start intercepting the message. The comm's officer will then match the incoming frequencies to lock on to the signal. Once this is complete, the FD will receive a notification that the signal is locked. At this point the FD can send an incoming message via the long-range comm's or print out a coded message via the printer (if it is configured.) After the code is decoded, the FD will want to uncheck the "Interception" checkbox to allow for future messages to be intercepted when that time comes. The FD should communicate to the crew that there is a possiblitiy to intercept a message.
