The crew can be configured from this screen. This is where non-player characters or NPC's can be added. These crew members will appear on the security, engineering, and medical team screens when building teams. They can also appear in the crew list and other places in the simulator. Simple information can be added to each of them allowing for a more in-depth story to be told.
