Damage Control will show what systems on the ship are damaged. Damage reports can then be requested from the FD or they can be automatically generated. The officer in charge of this card will need to then perform all the steps to repair the system as shown and then enter the reactivation code. This will prompt the FD to approve the repair and put that system back in action.
