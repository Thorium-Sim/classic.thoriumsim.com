## Summary

The **Alert Condition** screen allows you to adjust the alert condition (similar
to the DEFCON level) for the entire ship.

Alert conditions are easy ways of letting the entire crew know what the state of
the ship is. When you change the alert condition, everyone on the ship will
know.

To change Alert Conditions, simply click on the **Alert Condition** you want to
go to. You can move your mouse over the condition to see a description in the
**Alert Descriptions Box** of when the condition is applicable.
