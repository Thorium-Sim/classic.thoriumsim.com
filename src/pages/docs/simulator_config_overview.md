Thorium aims to be usable in any type of fictional universe with any kind of
simulator. This means it must be incredibly configurable. This does add a bit of
complexity, but hopefully these docs will help to clarify how to configure your
simulator.



On this screen, you will find a list of configurable modules for the simulator. See the other documentation for additional information.
