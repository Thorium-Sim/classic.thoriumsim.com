Thanks to BlueShadow, one of the community members, we have a launch script
which can be used for desktop or command-line Linux. It will

1. Check to see if Thorium is already running,
2. Launch the latest version of Thorium in the current directory.

To use this script:

1. [Download it](/launch-thorium.sh)
2. Put it in the same directory as your Thorium executable.
3. Make it executable by running `chmod u+x launch-thorium.sh`
4. Run it: `./launch-thorium.sh`
