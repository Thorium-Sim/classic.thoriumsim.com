At the top of the core, you can see and edit the beam angle. The phaser beam can be adjusted by clicking the top "Beam Angle" box. As the phasers fire, you can see the percentage decrease inside each yellow phaser charge box. 

Phasers can be charged by the Flight Director by clicking on the yellow box next to a phaser bank, and entering the desired phaser charge percentage.
