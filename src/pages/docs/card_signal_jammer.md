The Signal Jammer takes a lot of work from the FD as there are no notifications upon interaction. This can be paired with mission tasks etc. The user selects a frequency and power level to jam. Sensors of another ship could be jammed, the tactical guidance system of a torpedo could be jammed, and the communications systems from other ships could be jammed.
