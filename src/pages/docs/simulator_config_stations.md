Stations are configured on this screen. You can name the station and assign it any number of cards. These cards or functions give more responsibility and ability to that station. Widgets can also be added to each station. The "Executive" checkbox is used for the THX functionality (see separate docs for details.) The auto-login checkbox does just that - at simulation start, the station will not require the user to type their name and will skip that screen altogether. Message groups can also be assigned here, allowing that station to receive all messaging sent to that particular group.
