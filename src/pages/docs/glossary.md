- **Thorium:**A powerful modular software allowing cast and crew to embark on an
  incredible Space Edventure that is completely customizable. You'll never have
  the same experience twice!
- **Space Edventure**: An educational adventure in a simulated spaceship
  environment.
- **Flight Director (FD)**: The game master of the simulation. Flight Directors
  manage the back end of the controls, using them to tell the story. They are
  also in charge of the lighting, sound effects, voices, actors, and everything
  else involved in running the simulation.
- **Crew**: The people flying the space ship on the bridge. They act out their
  role as a member of the crew of the spaceship. Crew members typically are
  split into several different stations, or jobs. Their goal is to complete the
  mission successfully.
- **Simulator**: In the context of Thorium, the simulator is the computer
  representation of the ship which is flying. Simulators consist of systems,
  stations, decks, rooms, and crew.
- **Station**: A station is a collection of screens which control the simulator.
  Stations are typically organized by function; engines and thrusters belong to
  the Flight Control station, weapons and shields belong to the Tactical
  station, etc. Thorium groups sets of stations into station-sets, allowing you
  to customize how many crew participate in your simulation.
- **Client**: A client is a single computer running a station. To run Thorium,
  you must have at least one client for every station in the simulation, but you
  could have multiple clients running the same station on larger simulator sets.
- **Client**: A client is a single computer running a station. To run Thorium,
  you must have at least one client for every station in the simulation, but you
  could have multiple clients running the same station on larger simulator sets.
- **Server**: The main Thorium application that runs on a single computer that
  all Thorium clients connect to. The clients request data from the server and
  send messages to the server to update data. Clients can also subscribe to
  specific information from the server. When new information is processed by the
  server, it sends those updates to the subscribed clients.
- **Set**: A set is the physical space where a simulation happens. It could be
  permanent and include a bridge, desks for the computers, a sickbay and
  engineering room, hallways, transporter doors, etc. Or it could be your living
  room and computers for every participant. There is no set definition of what
  your spaceship has to look like! Thorium allows you to map the clients in your
  physical set to simulators and station-sets so you can easily start the ship
  before a flight.
- **Mission**: A mission is the set storyline which will be followed during a
  specific simulation. Missions follow a timeline of events, and can provide
  some level of automation for the Flight Director.
- **Flight**: A flight is a single experience that starts fresh with each crew
  change. Flights typically run anywhere from 2.5-5 hours; of course, flight
  times can be whatever you'd like.
