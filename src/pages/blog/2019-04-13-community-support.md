## A note about Support

Thorium is a "community support" project. This means that new features and
extended development are expected to come from the community of people using
Thorium. While I encourage everyone to use it and continue to submit issues and
bug reports, I won't be actively maintaining the project as I have in the past.
Here's what I will continue to do:

- Review issues on Github
- Review pull requests and provide feedback
- Merge pull requests
- Create new builds/releases
- Encourage and assist other developers

I will not:

- Actively build new features (usually -- some exceptions)
- Actively fix bugs (usually -- some exceptions)
- Guarantee a response or turnaround time
- Give support over phone or in person (except through service contract
  agreements)

Fortunately, you can get help from the excellent people on
[Thorium's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/UvxTQZz).

If you need better support for your Thorium simulator, I more than happy to
contract with you to do so. Fill out the
[Thorium Service Request Form](/service/) to start that process.

If you want to learn to contribute to Thorium, check out the
[development video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEU6NcOKhyE&list=PLvw0SNT6wHt9au1-6yCOh7QHj-p5ir0l6)
for how to get started.

Hope this helps!
