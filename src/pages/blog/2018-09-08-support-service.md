Announcing the Thorium Premium Support Service!

With more and more space centers using Thorium for their flights, the need for a
premium support system has never been greater.

Space Centers and flight directors can use the support system to request premium
support from a Thorium expert. They can request special features, priority bug
fixes, and even on-site visits or remote video calls.

This premium service costs less than the industry standard for on-site support
and intends to provide you with the highest-quality service for all of your
simulator controls needs.

Check out the frequently asked questions for more information and fill out the
service form here to request service! [Request Service](/service)
