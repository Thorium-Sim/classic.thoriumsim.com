* Created a core component for managing and importing crew from CSV
* Created security teams card
* Created damage teams card
* Damage reports are now processed to replace hashed keys for parts, reactivation codes, etc.
* Added reactivation codes. It automatically shows the reactivation code input field if the report has a #REACTIVATIONCODE hash key.

That's it for this week. Be sure to file any feature requests on the [Github repo](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues).
